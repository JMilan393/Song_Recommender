# Song Reccommender
https://github.com/JMilan393/Song_Recommender/tree/main \n
Need a new song to work out to? Or a new chill song to study to? Why not use the Song Recommender! This program will allow you to get recommended a song based on what criteria you select, such as mood, lyrics/no lyrics, etc.
It will have buttons or at the least dialouge options you go through to gert recommended a song. I plan for it to just ask the user a series of questions then it either gives them a link or plays it right there for them.
I need to learn how to play music in python.
My Ideal Outcome is I'm hoping to at least be able to have 3(?) different "paths" that can be recommended (maybe more depending on the difficulty), with 2 songs for each path for randomness.
My Minimum Viable Outcome is just having a simple like couple question quiz that recommends 2 different songs based on what you pick.
My milestones are kinda difficult to guess because of my time issues this semester, but this week hopefully I'll have the ability to play 1 song in python, then next week have one line of questions next week.

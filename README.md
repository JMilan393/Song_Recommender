## Description
A program that recommends you a song based on your current mood/ needs, from one of the greatest games ever!
All of the files in my repository are mainly audio files for the quiz taker to enjoy, and hopefully get them to get intrested in The World Ends With You, as it has one of the most diverse soundtracks I've ever heard and it has music for a lot of scenarios. I also have an mp4 file for when I was trying to add a cutscene but I couldn't get it to work unfortunately. Originally, I was gonna make this just general songs that I know, but then I got the idea to make this TWEWY themed and I kinda fell in love with the concept.

I really wanted to add little sprites/gifs that would move, but I didn't have the knowledge or time. I also wanted to make the menus more interactive with sound effects and more images but again, no time with other classes and such. I genuinely want to keep adding onto this, give it more questions and make it prettier, and of course fix the giant text problem.

I'm gonna put the text on here, so you can actually read what the quiz is asking: 

"What are you in the mood for today?"
"Techno, duh."
"Not feeling techno today..."

"Ah Techno! Great choice! Are you feeling more amped or more lowkey?"
"AMPED TO THE MAX!"
"please keep it chill."

"No Techno? No problem! JRock or R&B?"
"JRock is my life."
"R&B all day, any day!"

"You should listen to Insomnia, from NEO: TWEWY! Sit back and listen!"
"You should listen to Owari Hajimari, from NEO: TWEWY! Sit back and listen!"
"You should listen to Revelation, from NEO: TWEWY! (This is one of my personal favorites), Sit back and listen!"
"You should listen to Lulaby for You, from TWEWY! It's a very sweet song. Sit back and listen!"
